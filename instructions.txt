Description of the python files:

signs.py has code for calculate the signs of each vertex

longex has three versions, the old one has most likely some mistakes 
in intersection signs and do not take into account the difference between lower and upper swithes. The two modified ones seem to be equal, but the idea was to include end-sign difference in the twisted version.

p2calc has the signs of the sheets included, but the result sheets are a bit fishy. But this might be mistakes done by me when cleaning up in the files.

Y0calc has also the signs of the sheets included.

Y0Y1ecalc is an old try, notsure this makes sense.

y1ecalc has 2 versions. Both include signs of sheets, the twistend-version also includes a sign coming from the ends where we have to transform the boundary conditions in the aux-dir to be able to glue the capping operator. This sign is given by 'v'.


 
Description of result files:

longex: longex_relations_v2 is with signs from sheets, modified is without those signs, but with upper/lower switch difference. longex and longex_old har not these signs, and I shink they differ by intersection signs. 

p2: p2_realtions_v2 and p2rel_... might be fishy. Hopefully we don't need to use those. Here we have included signs from sheets. realtions_from_p2isotopy and simplified version of this should be ok and hopefully useful.

Y0: relations_Y0isotopy is without sheet-signs, relations_Y0v2 is with

eY1: relations_from_eY1isotopy is without sheet-signs, _v2 is with
