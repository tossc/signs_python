first isotopy
a	relation
0 	n + s_Y1(1, 0)
1 	n + s_Y1(1, 1)

second isotopy
a	relation
0 	n + s_Y1(0, 1) + 1
1 	n + s_Y1(1, 1)


in summary:
n = s_Y1(1, 0) = s_Y1(1, 1)
n + 1 = s_Y1(0, 1) 

so, in particular,

s_Y1(1, 0) = s_Y1(1, 1) = s_Y1(0, 1) + 1

rmk From long paper we have s_Y1(0,1) = 0 in case n =2 , which then is fischy
